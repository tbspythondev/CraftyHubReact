## CrafyHub: A Dynamic CRM Solution

# React + Vite

# Tech Stack:
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Backend: Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- Frontend: ReactJS
- Deployment: Docker

# Prerequisites:
- Docker installed (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
- Node.js and npm installed (https://nodejs.org/en)


# Running the Frontend (ReactJS) with Docker Compose:

- Navigate to your project's frontend directory (usually separate from the backend).

- Start the frontend services using:
    *Bash*: 
    - docker-compose build
    - docker-compose up

- This will typically start the frontend development server on a port like 3000 (check your React project setup). 

- You can access the frontend application at http://localhost:<port-number> in your browser.
